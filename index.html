                        <strong>❑</strong> DON'T COMPARE <br />
                        The only person you should try to beat is the person you were yesterday. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> LET IT GO <br />
                        Never run a good day by thinking about a bad yesterday. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> GIVE IT TIME <br />
                        Time heals everything. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> IGNORE THEM <br />
                        Don't listen to other people. Live a life that makes you feel strong and capable. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> IT'S ON YOU <br />
                        Only you are in charge of your happiness. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> STAY CALM <br />
                        It's okay not to have everything figured out. Know that in time, you'll get there. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> SMILE <br />
                        Life is short. Enjoy it while you have it. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> Don’t share your feelings with many people as you will just keep on repeating

                    <h1>What I learned from this book <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><u> Radical Acceptance</u>
                    </h1>
                    <p class="advice">
                        <strong>❑</strong> First off, be kinder to yourself. Seriously, we are often our harshest
                        critics. You don't have to beat yourself up every time you make a mistake. Instead, practice
                        self-compassion. Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend who's having a hard time.
                        Say encouraging things to yourself instead of focusing on the negative. It makes a huge
                        difference. <br>
                        <strong>❑</strong>Another thing is to practice mindfulness. This doesn't mean you have to
                        meditate for hours or anything. It's more about paying attention to your thoughts and feelings
                        without judging them. Just let them be. It's kind of like observing your thoughts as they come
                        and go without getting too caught up in them. When you can do that, you start to realize that
                        you don't have to believe every negative thought that pops into your head. <br>

                <div class="back">

                    <h1>What I learned from this book <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i><u> Radical Acceptance</u>
                    </h1>
                    <p class="advice">

                        <strong>❑</strong>Then there's shame and guilt. These are heavy feelings, and they can keep you
                        stuck if you let them. If you feel guilty about something, acknowledge it, make amends if you
                        can, but then let it go. Shame is trickier, but it's often about feeling like you're
                        fundamentally flawed. Tara Brach suggests that with mindfulness and compassion, you can start to
                        heal from these feelings. It's not an overnight thing, but with practice, you can lighten that
                        load. <br>
                        <strong>❑</strong>Finally, remember that nobody's perfect. I know, it sounds cliché, but it's
                        true. We all have our flaws and shortcomings, and that's okay. Embrace imperfection. When you
                        stop trying to be perfect, you open yourself up to a more authentic and fulfilling life. It's a
                        relief to just be who you are, without the constant pressure to measure up to some unrealistic
                        standard.

                        I've mentioned your social media usage a few times because I care about how you spend your time.
                        I want you to focus on things that are more meaningful. It's okay to use social media, but I
                        hope you don't spend nearly the whole day on it. It'd be great if you could be more disciplined
                        about it.
