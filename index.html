                        <strong>❑</strong> DON'T COMPARE <br />
                        The only person you should try to beat is the person you were yesterday. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> LET IT GO <br />
                        Never run a good day by thinking about a bad yesterday. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> GIVE IT TIME <br />
                        Time heals everything. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> IGNORE THEM <br />
                        Don't listen to other people. Live a life that's empowering to you. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> IT'S ON YOU <br />
                        Only you are in charge of your happiness. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> STAY CALM <br />
                        It's okay not to have everything figured out. Know that in time, you'll get there. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> SMILE <br />
                        Life is short. Enjoy it while you have it. <br />

                        <strong>❑</strong> Don’t share your feelings with many people as you will just keep on repeating the same thing and your mind will be thinking about it only <br />
